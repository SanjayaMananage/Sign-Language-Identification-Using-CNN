# Sign-Language-Identification-Using-CNN
In this project, I used the Sign Language MNIST dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist). The original sign language images were processed into pixel intensity values and structured into numerical arrays suitable for model training. I then implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a classification model capable of accurately identifying American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures. The project demonstrates image preprocessing, deep learning model development, and performance evaluation for multi-class image classification tasks.
